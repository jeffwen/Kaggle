# What's Cooking?

This repository contains the code that I used to place in the top 10% (100th) out of 1,416 teams/ individuals.

* Please note that the code [code](cooking.py) contains many different functions/ code snippets that were used to preprocess and analyze the data; therefore, the code cannot be run directly. It serves mainly as a referece for myself and anyone else who might want to look at it.

The winning solution scored 0.81225 on the public leaderboard.
